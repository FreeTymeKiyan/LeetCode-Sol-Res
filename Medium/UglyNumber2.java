/**
 * Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
 *
 * Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,
 * 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
 *
 * Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
 *
 * Hint:
 *
 * The naive approach is to call isUgly for every number until you reach the nth one. Most numbers are not ugly. Try to
 * focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.
 *
 * An ugly number must be multiplied by either 2, 3, or 5 from a smaller ugly number.
 *
 * The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers. Try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists:
 * L1, L2, and L3.
 *
 * Assume you have Uk, the kth ugly number. Then Uk+1 must be Min(L1 * 2, L2 * 3, L3 * 5).
