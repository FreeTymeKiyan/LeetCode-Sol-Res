This repository contains solutions and resources for [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) algorithm problems.  

The solutions are derived from my own thinking and the discussion. They are cleaned and optimized carefully, thus more readable and understandable!  

An excel table for quick review before interview is also provided in resources directory.

* Idea: the description of the general idea of the solution.  
* Code: key steps in implementation.  
* Tips: summary of tricks and tips appeared in solutions.  
* New Problems: put into a single page because frequency is unknown.  
  
Important and hard problems have **bold title** and key points are **marked red**.
