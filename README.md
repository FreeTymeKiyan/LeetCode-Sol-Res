This repository contains Java solutions and resources for [LeetCode Online Judge](https://oj.leetcode.com) algorithm problems.  

Most of the solutions are derived from my own implementation, the problem discussion section and [ninechapter.com](http://www.ninechapter.com), which are cleaned and optimized carefully, thus more readable and understandable!  

An excel table for quick review before interview is also provided in resources directory.

Each problem row has name, level, idea, code and frequency analysis.  

* Frequency: derived from online resources and interview experience.  
* Idea: the description of the general idea of the solution.  
* Code: key steps in implementation.  
* Tips: summary of tricks and tips appeared in solutions.  
* New Problems: put into a single page because frequency is unknown.  
  
Important and hard problems have **bold title** and key points are **marked red**.
