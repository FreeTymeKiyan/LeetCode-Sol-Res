/**
 * Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least

 * Note: You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only). You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
 * Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2). There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be
 * repeated more than once.
